HOW TO SET UP THE PYTHON # ENVIRONMENT FOR MARCout

1. Install Python 3 (this MARCout repo has not been written for Python 2.)
  - Debian/Ubuntu: 
    `sudo apt install python-3`
  -Mac OSX:
  
2. Set up virtual environment. The general syntax is:
    `python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`
    
  From the root of your local copy of this repo, that will be
    `python3 -m venv .`
    
  Then verify with `ls`. The new virtual environment content should look something like this:
    `bin  include  lib  lib64  pyvenv.cfg  share`
    
3. Upgrade the `pip` Python package manager, and `setuptools` packaging utility, in your virtual 
environment. (The versions of these that ship with Python are minimal, and generally behind
the times.)

  First, activate the virtual environment:
    `source bin/activate`
  This will change your command prompt, prepending the directory in which your active virtual 
  environment config/install resides.
  
  (To exit the virtual environment, use `deactivate`.)
  
  (Pro tip: the `source bin/activate` command is idempotent. You can re-run it as many times 
  as you like without additional effect.)
  
  Next, perform the upgrade. IF YOUR VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT IS NOT ACTIVATED, THIS WILL BE A GLOBAL UPGRADE.
    `pip install -U pip setuptools`

4. Install the Flask webservice. Again, MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT.
  `pip install Flask`
